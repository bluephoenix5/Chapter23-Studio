        <h1>My Adventures in UAE</h1>

        <h2>Surfing the sand dunes</h2>
        
        <p>This was a fun experience. The drivers pulled over before we got to the dunes and let some of the air out of the tires. We were sliding sideways down the dunes! This was all followed by dinner in the desert and a nice sunset.</p>

        <h2>Ferrari World</h2>

        <p>This is where Formula Rossa, the world's fastest roller coaster is located. This roller coaster is so fast that they make you wear eye protection to ride it!</p>


        <h2>The Dubai Mall</h2>

        <p>This mall is the largest in the world by total land area. There are several attractions located inside of the mall, including the Dubai Aquarium and Underwater Zoo.</p>


        <h2>Burj Khalifa</h2>

        <p>This is the tallest building in the world. The height is a little over half a mile tall! </p>
